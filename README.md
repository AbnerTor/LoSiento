# LoSiento - Learn Spanish Fast!

![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

LoSiento is a simple language learning app that utilizes the power of IBM's Watson to help you learn Spanish. It was created by Rony Braswell, Sam Gates, Brian McMullen, and Abner Toribio.

The app utilizes a database of custom, ten-word lessons that are originally written in English. When a user selects a lesson, our API queries Watson and builds a flashcard based lesson for them. The front of the flashcard is the English word, and the back is Spanish. Our app keeps track of the lessons you complete, and displays user activity on the front page. All of this is done to encourage more learning. Quickly learn Spanish or keep your mind on Spanish while you're on the go!
